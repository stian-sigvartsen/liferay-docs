# Form Field Types [](id=form-field-types)

A form without fields is no form at all. To meet your form-building needs,
Liferay Forms provides useful and highly configurable field types. To see
examples of the form fields described here, visit the [Collecting Information from
Users](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/collecting-information-from-users)
section of the User Guide.

Form Text
: This is static text on the form. Users do not enter data into Form Text
fields. The form creator enters text that form users see displayed on the form.
This is useful for longer instructions.

Text Field
: Users enter text into these fields. For example, a Full Name field is a text
field. By default, a text field keeps all input on a single line of text. To
accommodate longer responses, choose the multi-line setting when
configuring the text field 
[as in this example](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/basic-forms#building-a-form).
Place limits on the text users can enter (numbers from 1-10, or email addresses,
for example) by using the Text field's validation options (as in [this
example](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-advanced-forms#validating-text-fields)).

Select from List
: Users select one (or more, if configured to allow it) options from a 
list of choices. Choices are entered manually or automatically populated by
a data provider. For example, a Country of Residence field can be a
select from list field populated by a Countries of the World data provider.

Single Selection
: Using a radio button, users select one option from a list of options displayed
on the form.

Date
: Users select a date using a date picker. For example, a Birth Date field uses
the Date field type.

Multiple Selection/Single Checkbox
: Users select one or more options from check boxes (or switchers, if
configured). The Single Checkbox field is only available to Digital Enterprise
subscribers, but its functionality can be obtained with the Multiple
Selection field. The Single Checkbox field will be removed in the next version
of Liferay DXP Digital Enterprise.

<!-- Unreleased fields
Grid
: Using radio buttons, users select from options laid out in rows and columns.
One selection can be made per row. This is useful when the same response metric
is needed for multiple questions. For example, a product survey form might ask
users to rate a list of their product's characteristics as Wonderful, Pretty
Good, Not So Good, or Awful.

Numeric
: Users enter numeric data (integers or decimals) into numeric fields.
Non-number input is not accepted. For example, configure a numeric field that
accepts integers to ask users how many pets they have.
