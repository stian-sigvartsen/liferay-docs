# OAuth2 Scopes 

In OAuth 2.0, applications are granted access to limited subsets of user data.
These are called *scopes* (not to be confused with Liferay scopes). They are
created in two ways: 

1.  By administrators, by creating a Service Access Policy for the scope

2.  By developers, by creating a JAX-RS endpoint and marking it with a special
    annotation

## Creating a Scope for a JSONWS Service

The most common way to create a scope is to create a 
[Service Access Policy](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/service-access-policies)
prefixed with the name `oauth2_`. This naming convention causes the policy to appear
in the OAuth application configuration screen as a scope. 

For example, say the application needs access to a user's profile information in
order to retrieve the email address. To grant the application access to this, go
to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Service Access Policy*, and
create the policy pictured below.

Note that the policy is not a default policy, and that it grants access only to
one method in the `UserService`. This is a JSONWS web service generated by
Service Builder. You can view a list of all available services in your
installation at this URL: 

    http://[host]:[port]/api/jsonws/

Once you create a policy and name it with the `oauth2_` prefix, it appears in
the *Scopes* tab in OAuth2 Administration.

Now you can select it and save your application. 

## Creating a Scope for a JAX-RS Service

Developers creating JAX-RS web services can make their services appear as OAuth
2.0 scopes by annotating endpoint resource methods or whole classes like this: 

    @RequiresScope("scopeName")

Once deployed, this becomes a scope in the OAuth 2.0 configuration. 

Great! Now that you understand scopes, it's time to make the authorization
process happen in your application.
