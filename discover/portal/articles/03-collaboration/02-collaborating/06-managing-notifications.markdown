# Managing Notifications and Requests [](id=managing-notifications-and-requests)

If you subscribed to a blog or message board, or if someone sent you a
private message, invitation, event reminder, or mentioned you in a post, you
received a notification or request.

The notifications icon on your profile image shows your number of unread
notifications or requests.

![Figure 1: The number of notifications and requests are displayed above your profile image](../../../images/notifications-icon.png)

To access notifications and requests, you can click the notifications 
icon on your user profile image or open the Control Menu and select 
*My Account* &rarr; *Notifications* under the user menu. The 
*Notifications List* section is selected by default. This is where all your 
notifications are displayed. Click the *Requests List* link in the Navbar to 
view and manage your requests.

## Managing Notifications [](id=managing-notifications)

Notifications can pile up after some time, especially if you were away for a few
days. Since Liferay DXP Fix Pack 30 and Liferay Portal 7.0 CE GA5, the
Management Bar gives you several ways to filter and sort your notifications. 

The following filters are available for notifications:

**All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications.

**Unread:** displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread 
notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the 
notification.

**Read:** displays notifications that have been marked as read

You can also sort notifications by *Date*. By default notifications are 
listed by date in descending order. Click the up arrow icon in the management 
bar to sort notifications by ascending order. The down arrow icon reverses this. 

To mark notifications, select *Mark as read* or *Mark as unread* from the
actions menu for the notification. The *Delete* action permanently deletes the
notification.

### Managing Multiple Notifications [](id=managing-multiple-notifications)

You can also manage multiple notifications at once. Select the checkbox next to
notifications you want to manage and choose an option from the Management Bar.
Select the checkbox above the notifications list to select all notifications on
the current page. A blue border on the bottom marks selected notifications.
Selected notifications show three actions: an open envelope button (![Open
Envelope](../../../images/button-envelope-open.png)) (mark as read); a closed
envelope button (![Closed Envelope](../../../images/button-envelope-closed.png))
(mark as unread); and an x button (![Delete
Button](../../../images/button-delete.png)) (delete).

Selecting the *Mark all notifications as read* action in the app's actions menu
marks them as read.

**Note:** This feature is only available if at least one notification is unread. 
Clicking it marks all notifications as read, selected or not.

**This action can not be undone.** You must manually paginate through all 
the notifications and either bulk mark them as unread for the page, or 
individually mark the notifications as unread if you wish to change the state.

## Managing Requests [](id=managing-requests)

When you get a request, it appears in the *Requests List* section. 
In its Action menu, you can click *Confirm* to accept, *Ignore* to decline, or
*Delete* to remove the request.
