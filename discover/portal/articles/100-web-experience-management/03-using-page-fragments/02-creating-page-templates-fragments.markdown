# Building Content Pages from Fragments [](id=building-content-pages-from-fragments)

After you create Fragments, your next step is to add them to a Page Template 
that will become a Content Page. Content Pages are composed of some number of 
Fragments - it could be one or it could be fifty.

## Creating a Page Template [](id=creating-a-page-template)

You can create Page Templates in the *Site Pages* page in Site Administration.

1.  From Site Administation for your site, go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Site 
    Pages*.

2.  Select the Page Templates tab.

Like Fragments, Page Templates must be created in Collections. You see all of 
your current Collections at the root of the Page Templates page. Collections 
will also enable you to quickly select templates when creating pages. Next you 
want to create a Page Template.

1.  Click the `+` icon to *Add Collection*.

2.  *Name* your Collection, provide a *Description*, and click *Save*.

3.  Click on the new Collection.

4.  Click the `+` icon from inside of the Collection to *Add Page Template*.

5.  Set the *Name* and click *Submit*.

Now you're on the Page Template creation page. Fragments are added by selecting 
a Collection from the *Fragments* tab on the right and adding them to the page. 
You can add multiple Fragments from different collections, and you can add the 
same Fragment to the page multiple times. To see which Fragments the current 
page is made up of, you can check the *Added* tab. The template is 
automatically saved as you work. Click on the back arrow at the top to stop 
editing the template.

## Creating a Content Page [](id=creating-a-content-page)

After you are done creating a Page Template you can use that template to create 
a Content Page. A Content Page is basically a page created from Fragments. 
Unlike Liferay Layout pages that can be edited directly from the page itself, 
it can only be changed or updated by editing the Template it is based on or the 
Fragments that make up the Template. To create a Content Page:

1.  Go back to the main *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* page.

2.  Click the `+` button for *Add Page*.

3.  Click on the tab for the Collection which contains the template you want to 
    use.

3.  Enter a *Name*.

4.  Click Save.

Alternatively, you can select the page type first, and then the template. After you click the `+` to add a page do the following:

1.  Select the *Basic Pages* tab.

2.  Select *Content*.

3.  Choose the *Page Template* you want to use from the selector.

4.  Click *Add Page*
    
By default, your new page will be added to the Navigation Menu and users can 
access the page you created. If you didn't know that there was anything other 
than the default Navigation Menu, head over to our [link]Navigation Menu 
tutorial.
