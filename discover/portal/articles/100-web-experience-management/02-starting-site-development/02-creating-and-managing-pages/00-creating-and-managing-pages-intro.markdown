# Creating and Managing Pages [](id=creating-and-managing-pages)

You've successfully created a site for your Liferay instance, but you may need
to add new pages or edit existing pages. From the Site Administration &rarr;
*Navigation* section of the Menu, you can configure site pages. If you're not
currently on the site you want to edit, click the *Site Selector* button
(![Compass](../../../../images/icon-compass.png)) next to your current site name
in the Menu and select your desired site. The edits you make to your pages are
only made to the scope you've selected in the Menu.

![Figure 1: The Sites Pages page allows you to edit your site pages as a whole.](../../../../images/managing-site-pages.png)

Open the Navigation tab and click on *Site Pages* to manage pages. From here, 
you'll manage your public and private page sets as well as page templates. 
Page sets are always associated with sites. Even users' personal pages are part 
of their personal sites. All pages belong to one of two types of page sets: 
public pages and private pages. By default, public pages are accessible to 
anyone, even non-logged in users (guests). Private pages are accessible only to
users who are members of the site that owns the pages. This means the private
pages of an organization's site are viewable only by site members and members of
the organization. 

The same interface manages pages regardless of whether the pages are public or
private. You'll look at this interface more closely next.
