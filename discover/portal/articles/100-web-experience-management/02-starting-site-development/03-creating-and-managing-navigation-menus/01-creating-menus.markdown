# Creating and Managing Navigation Menus [](id=creating-and-managing-navigation-menus)

While you can stick to the default, you can also create multiple, customizable 
menus to take advantage of different features in Liferay.

## Creating a Navigation Menu [](id=creating-a-navigation-menu)

Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Navigation* &rarr; *Navigation Menus* to 
get started with Navigation Menus. Click on the `+` button to add a new menu.
Give your menu a name and click *Submit*. On the next page, you're presented
with a number of elements that you can add to a menu.

**Page**: Select an existing page from the current site to add to the navigation
menu.

**Submenu**: Use this to create a second level of menu navigation.

**URL**: Create a link to any page outside of the current site or portal with
a URL link, which appears just like any other option in your menu.
 
Click on *Page* and you see a view of all the current pages on the current site.
Select a page and click *Add* to add that page to the menu.

**Note:** When you click on a page, you select that page. Multiple pages can
be selected by clicking on each page one at a time. To deselect a page click on
the page again.

Now you are menu management screen. From here, you can drag and drop menu 
elements to rearrange or nest them. You can also manage options for this menu by
clicking the gear icon in the top right. Let's add another item to the menu.

1.  Click the `+` icon.

2.  Select *Submenu* in the menu that pops up.

3.  Name your menu "External Links".

4.  Click *Add*.

Click the `+` button again and select URL. You're prompted to enter a page
name and URL.

1.  Enter a *Name*.

2.  Enter the *URL* for an external site.

3.  Click *Add*.

Drag the URL item onto the *External Links* submenu. This nests the URL item in
the submenu.

Now that you understand the basics of creating menus, you learn the details.

## Managing Menus [](id=managing-menus)

After you create a menu, more configuration options appear on the main
Navigation Menus page. 

**Title**: Your menu's name. 

**Add New Pages**: Determines if new pages added to the main navigation are
added to the menu automatically. 

**Marked As**: Can be set as *Primary Navigation*, *Secondary Navigation*, or
*Social Navigation*.
 
**Author**: The user that created the menu.

**Create Date**: When the menu was created.

The menu types are used primarily for theme and fragment developers to 
determine how a menu should be styled. **Primary Navigation** is for the main
navigation for a page. **Secondary Navigation** is for a second level of
navigation, possibly a side bar or a separate menu within a page. **Social
Navigation** is for menus that containing links for sharing content on social
media or similar tasks.

### Modifying Menus [](id=modifying-menus)

Next click on the options menu at the far left of your new navigation menu. 
You'll see these options:

**Edit**: Takes you to the interface for adding, removing, and organizing menu
items.

**Rename**: Change the name of your menu.

**Permissions**: Define who can view, update, delete, and manage the permissions
for the menu.
 
**Mark As**: Change the menu type.

**Delete**: Deletes the menu.

These are all the tools you need to create and manage Liferay's powerful 
Navigation Menus.
