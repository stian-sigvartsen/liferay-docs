# Starting Site Development [](id=starting-site-development)

A site is a set of pages where content or applications are published. Sites can
be independent or serve as an associated organization's web site. You can create
as many different sites as you like within the context of a single Liferay
instance.

You'll start with a tour of @product@'s user interface. Next, you'll create a 
custom Lunar Resort Example instance and explore ways to create sites and pages 
for that Liferay instance. There are many different ways to manage your sites 
and pages, which is also covered. To begin site development, continue on to the
next section.
