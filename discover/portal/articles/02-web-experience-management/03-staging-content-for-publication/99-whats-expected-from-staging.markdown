# What's Expected from Staging?

Have you ever wondered what happens to an entity during the Staging process?
Does Staging recognize the change? If so, how does it handle the update?

This article lists use cases for each Liferay entity. The use case tables have
three columns:

- *Related entity:* the entity attached/related to the table's main
  entity. For example, in the Web Content Article (main entity) table, an
  attached entity could be a structure.
- *Action performed:* the type of modification completed on the related entity.
- *How does Staging handle this?:* how the Staging framework handles the
  action performed.

Navigate to the entity section you want.

## Web Content

The sections below describe how Staging handles a specific web content entity
and the various actions that can be performed on its attached/related entities.

### Web Content Article

The following table describes how entities that are attached/related to a web
content (WC) article are handled during the Staging process.

|              | Structure is deleted | Structures with articles using it or other structures using it can not be deleted. There could be an issue on import deletion that cannot happen because there are still dependencies using this in live.
