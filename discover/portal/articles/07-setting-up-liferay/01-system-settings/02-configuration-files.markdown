# Understanding System Configuration Files [](id=understanding-system-configuration-files)

@product@'s 
[System Settings application](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/system-settings) 
is convenient for making system-scoped configuration changes and setting default
configurations for other
[scopes](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-liferay#configuration-scope).
But there's another supported configuration approach: configuration files. You
can use configuration files to transfer configurations from pre-production
systems to production systems, or between any other @product@ systems. Sometimes
developers choose to distribute the default configuration for their applications
via configuration file. Whatever the reason, configuration files are
a straightforward way of configuring @product@.

## Creating Configuration Files [](id=creating-configuration-files)

System Settings provides an
[*Export*](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/system-settings#exporting-and-importing-configurations)
option that becomes available once you modify a configuration entry. Exporting
is the recommended way to create `.config` files: you download a `.config` file
containing the entry's settings in a `key=value` format. @product@ exports an
entry's total available configuration keys and values, even if only one value
was changed. You can export a single configuration entry or the entire set of
modified configurations in @product@.

To avoid a file name conflict, name configuration files using a unique
identifier. For example, the Journal Service entry, which backs Liferay's Web
Content capabilities, has this file name:

    com.liferay.journal.configuration.JournalServiceConfiguration.config

![Figure 1: The Web Content System Settings entry has the backend ID `com.liferay.journal.configuration.JournalServiceConfiguration`.](../../../images/config-web-content-entry.png)

Configuration files use the `.config` property value format defined by the [Apache
Felix Configuration Admin
framework](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-config-admin.html).

The `.cfg` file format is common in OSGi environments, so @product@ supports it,
but `.config` files are preferable. You can specify a property value's type, and
have multi-valued properties. The syntax described below is for `.config` files.

### Key/Value Syntax [](id=key-value-syntax)

The general syntax for all keys and values in a `.config` file is the same: 

    configurationName="value"

For single value configurations without special characters, that's all there is
to know. Settings with multiple values and certain characters require slight
modifications. 

### Multi-Value Settings [](id=multi-value-settings)

Configuration entries can have properties that accept multiple values. For
example, a configuration property for specifying supported file extensions needs
more than one value. Here's how to write a multi-value setting in a `.config`
file: 

    multiValueSetting=["Value 1", "Value 2", ...]

Open the Web Content entry from System Settings and you'll see what looks like
multiple single value entries for *Charactersblacklist*: 

![Figure 2: The Web Content System Settings entry has many *Charactersblacklist* fields.](../../../images/config-web-content-blacklist.png)

In the configuration file, this is really a single key with an array of 
comma-separated values: 

    charactersblacklist=["&","'","@","\\","]","}",":","\=",">","/","<","[","{","%","+","#","`","?","\"",";","*","~"]

### Escaping Characters [](id=escaping-characters)

Double quotes (`"`) and equals signs (`=`) must be *escaped* in `.config` files. 
Escaping is using another character to denote that a character shouldn't be used 
in its normal way. Since double quotes and equals signs are already used in 
`.config` files, escaping them tells the framework not to read them the normal 
way, but to pass them through as part of the value. Use a `\\` to escape 
characters in the `.config` file: 

    charactersblacklist=["&","\"","\="]

This setting illustrates a multi-value setting with a regular, unescaped 
character (`&`), and two escaped ones (`\"` and `\=`). 

### Deploying a Configuration File [](id=deploying-a-configuration-file)

Once you have a configuration file, deploy it so @product@ recognizes it and 
updates the targeted configuration values. 

To deploy the `.config` file, place it in your 
[Liferay Home's](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-product#liferay-home) 
`osgi/configs` folder. To change the configuration further, you can edit the 
`.config` file directly or use System Settings. 

### Typed Values [](id=typed-values)

The `.config` file format supports specifying the type of a configuration value
by inserting a special type marker character. Because @product@ already knows
the correct type for each configuration property, the type characters are only
useful for informational purposes. For example, a configuration with a boolean
type has *B* just before the value to mark it as a boolean type:

    addDefaultStructures=B"true"

If you see type markers in `.config` files, you can safely ignore them. The
example included above functions identically without the type marker: 

    addDefaultStructures="true"

## Configuration Files and Clustering [](id=configuration-files-and-clustering)

In a clustered environment, each node needs the same configuration values for
each entry. For example, all nodes should use the same *Blogs* configuration
settings. To accomplish this, deploy a `.config` file to *one* node. @product@
uses an internal system that appies the change to all nodes in the cluster. 

## Factory Configurations [](id=factory-configurations)

Configurations supporting multiple independent occurrences of the same
configuration entry are called *factory configurations*.

+$$$

**Factory Configuration Example:** @product@ supports the publication of 
[JAX-WS and JAX-RS web services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/jax-ws-and-jax-rs). 
These services must use a 
[CXF Endpoint](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/jax-ws-and-jax-rs#cxf-endpoints),
which is a context path where the web services are deployed and accessed.
Endpoints can be created via factory configuration by navigating to the CXF
Endpoints System Settings Entry (System Settings &rarr; Foundation &rarr; CXF
Endpoints). Using the Add button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)), 
enter the desired configuration values and repeat the process, adding as many
CXF Endpoint configurations as needed. Creating CXF Endpoint configurations also
creates CXF Endpoints themselves. This is how factory configuration works. 

$$$

If a service is meant to support factory configuration, its System Settings
entry has an Add button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)).

![Figure 3: If a System Settings entry has an Add button, it's suitable for factory configuration.](../../../images/factory-configuration-entry.png)

As with single-instance configurations, you can accomplish factory
configuration in the System Settings interface (as described in the example
above) or via configuration files. Once you determine you must write a factory
configuration file. Name a standard single-instance configuration file like
this:

    my.service.ServiceConfiguration.config

If your service supports factory configuration, use Liferay's convention
of calling the first instance of the configuration `-default.config`:

    my.service.ServiceConfiguration-default.config

The next instance contains a unique *subname* (something other than *default*).
It's smart to use a descriptive name:

    my.service.ServiceConfiguration-port9080.config

To follow the CXF Endpoints example described above, if Liferay's developers had
shipped an initial CXF Endpoint `.config` file with @product@, it would have
been named

    com.liferay.portal.remote.cxf.common.configuration.CXFEndpointPublisherConfiguration-default.config

Perhaps the `-default.config` configuration specifies a context path for *REST*
web services, and then you create another endpoint with a different context path
for *SOAP* web services. Your second configuration file could be named

    com.liferay.portal.remote.cxf.common.configuration.CXFEndpointPublisherConfiguration-soap.config

+$$$

**Note:** Some System Settings entries (like the CXF Endpoints entry) don't ship
with a configuration file, so anything you create is the first occurrence.
However, if you configure one and export it to obtain the `.config` file, it's
not named `-default.config`. Instead it's given a guaranteed unique identifier
for its subname, like

    com.liferay.portal.remote.cxf.common.configuration.CXFEndpointPublisherConfiguration-a6f67e48-6dca-49c6-bf6b-8fd5e6016b2d.config

This is to guarantee that the file has a unique name. If you're exporting
the configuration file for deployment in a *separate @product@ system*, you can
rename the exported file to use a more descriptive subname. If you rename the
file and deploy it to the same system it was exported from, the new
subname marks it as an entirely new configuration. You'll end up with an
additional configuration instance in this case, not just a renamed one.

$$$

Now a note of warning. In many cases, configuration files can be used to force a
factory configuration scenario, but not all configurations are designed to be
used this way. It's best to stick to the intended use cases. Use System Settings
as described above to determine if factory configuration is a good idea. If not,
stick to the single occurrence mode of configuration (specifying only one
configuration file for the service).
