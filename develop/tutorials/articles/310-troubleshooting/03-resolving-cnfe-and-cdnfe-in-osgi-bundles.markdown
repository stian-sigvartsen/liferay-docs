# Resolving ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError in OSGi Bundles [](id=resolving-classnotfoundexception-and-noclassdeffounderror-in-osgi-bundles)

Understanding a `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` in non-OSGi
environments is straightforward. 

-   `ClassNotFoundException`: thrown when looking up a class that isn't on the
    classpath or using an invalid name to look up a class that isn't on the
    runtime classpath. 
-   `NoClassDefFoundError`: occurs when a compiled class references
    another class that isn't on the runtime classpath.

In OSGi environments, however, there are additional cases where a
`ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` can occur. Here are three:

1.  The missing class belongs to a module dependency that's an OSGi module. 
2.  The missing class belongs to a module dependency that's *not* an OSGi 
    module. 
3.  The missing class belongs to a global library, either at the @product@ 
    webapp scope or the application server scope. 

This tutorial explains how to handle each case.

## Case 1: The Missing Class Belongs to an OSGi Module [](id=case-1-the-missing-class-belongs-to-an-osgi-module)

In this case, there are two possible causes: 

1.  **The module doesn't import the class's package:** For a module (or WAB) to 
    consume another module's exported class, the consuming module must import 
    the exported package that contains the class. To do this, you add an
    `Import-Package` header in the consuming module's `bnd.bnd` file. If the
    consuming module tries to access the class without importing it, a 
    `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` occurs. 

    In the consuming module, make sure you import the correct package. First 
    check the package name. If the package import is correct but you still get 
    the exception or error, the class might no longer exist in the package. 

2.  **The class no longer exists in the imported package:** In OSGi runtime 
    environments, modules can change and come and go. If you reference another
    module's class that its developer removed, a `NoClassDefFoundError` or
    `ClassNotFoundException` occurs.
    [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) 
    guards against this scenario: removing a class from an 
    exported package constitutes a new major version for that package. 
    Neglecting to increment the package's major version breaks dependent 
    modules. 

    For example, say a module that consumes the class `com.foo.Bar` specifies the 
    package import `com.foo;version=[1.0.0, 2.0.0)`. The module uses `com.foo` 
    versions from `1.0.0` up to (but not including) `2.0.0`. The first part of 
    the version number (the `1` in `1.0.0`) represents the *major* version. The 
    consuming module doesn't expect any *major* breaking changes, like a class 
    removal. Removing `com.foo.Bar` from `com.foo` without incrementing the 
    package to a new major version (e.g., `2.0.0`) causes a 
    `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError` when other modules look 
    up or reference that class. 

    You have these options since the class no longer exists in the package: 

    -   Adapt to the new API. To learn how to do this, read the 
        package's/module's Javadoc, release notes, and or formal documentation. 
        You can also ask the author, or search forums. 

    -   Revert to the module version you used previously. Deployed module 
        versions reside in `[Liferay_Home]/osgi/`. For details, see
        [Backing up Liferay Installations](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/backing-up-a-liferay-installation#backing-up-liferays-file-system). 

    Do what you think is best to get your module working properly. 

Now you know how to resolve common situations involving `ClassNotFoundException` 
or `NoClassDefFoundError`. For additional information on `NoClassDefFoundError`, 
see OSGi Enroute's article 
[What is NoClassDefFoundError?](http://enroute.osgi.org/faq/class-not-found-exception.html). 

## Case 2: The Missing Class Doesn't Belong to an OSGi Module [](id=case-2-the-missing-class-doesnt-belong-to-an-osgi-module)

In this case, you have two options: 

1.  Convert the dependency into an OSGi module so it can export the missing 
    class. Converting a non-OSGi `JAR` file dependency into an OSGi module that 
    you can deploy alongside your application is the ideal solution, so it
    should be your first choice. 

2.  Embed the dependency in your module by embedding the dependency `JAR` file's
    packages as private packages in your module. If you want to embed a non-OSGi
    `JAR` file in your application, see the tutorial 
    [Adding Third Party Libraries to a Module](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/adding-third-party-libraries-to-a-module). 

## Case 3: The Missing Class Belongs to a Global Library [](id=case-3-the-missing-class-belongs-to-a-global-library)

In this case, you can configure @product@ so the OSGi system module exports 
the missing class's package. Then your module can import it. You should **NOT**, 
however, undertake this lightly. If Liferay intended to make a global library 
available for use by developers, the system module would already export this
library! Still, if you must access a global library that's not currently 
exported and can't think of **any** other solution, you can consider adding the 
required package for export by the system module. There are two ways to do this: 

1.  In your `portal-ext.properties` file, use the property
    `module.framework.system.packages.extra` to specify the packages to export. 

2.  If the package you need is from a @product@ JAR, you might be able to add 
    the module to the list of exported packages in
    `[LIFERAY_HOME]/osgi/core/com.liferay.portal.bootstrap.jar`'s
    `META-INF/system.packages.extra.bnd` file. Try this option 
    only if the first option doesn't work. 

If the package you need is from a @product@ module, (i.e., it's **NOT** 
from a global library), you can add the package to that module's `bnd.bnd` 
exports. You should **NOT**, however, undertake this lightly. The package would
already be be exported if Liferay intended for it to be available.
