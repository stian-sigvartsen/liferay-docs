# Creating a Fragment for Entry List Screenlet [](id=creating-a-fragment-for-entry-list-screenlet)

Using a fragment for Entry List Screenlet lets you swap out part of 
`GuestbookActivity`'s contents without recreating the entire activity from 
scratch each time a guestbook is selected. Your app doesn't currently have any 
fragments, though. In this step, you'll create a fragment and then add it to 
`GuestbooksActivity`. When you finish, you'll be ready to use Entry List 
Screenlet in this fragment. 

## Creating the Fragment [](id=creating-the-fragment)

Follow these steps to create the fragment: 

1.  To create the fragment, right click the `com.liferay.docs.liferayguestbook`
    package and select *New* &rarr; *Fragment* &rarr; *Fragment (Blank)*. In the
    wizard, check only the box to create the layout XML, name the fragment
    `EntriesFragment`, and then click *Finish*. The following screenshot
    illustrates this:

    ![Figure 1: Create a new blank fragment for the entries.](../../../images/android-create-fragment.png)

    This creates the `EntriesFragment` class and its layout file 
    `fragment_entries.xml`. 

2.  Replace the class's contents with this code: 

        package com.liferay.docs.liferayguestbook;

        import android.os.Bundle;
        import android.support.v4.app.Fragment;
        import android.view.LayoutInflater;
        import android.view.View;
        import android.view.ViewGroup;

        public class EntriesFragment extends Fragment {

            public static EntriesFragment newInstance(long guestbookId) {
                EntriesFragment entriesFragment = new EntriesFragment();
                Bundle args = new Bundle();
                args.putLong("guestbookId", guestbookId);
                entriesFragment.setArguments(args);

                return entriesFragment;
            }

            @Override
            public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                // Inflate the layout for this fragment
                View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_entries, container, false);
                long guestbookId = getArguments().getLong("guestbookId");

                return view;
            }

        }

    If you have experience with Android fragments, then you're likely familiar 
    with the static `newInstance` method. In short, using such a method instead 
    of an empty constructor lets you create the fragment and initialize its data 
    in one step. This makes it easier to create and restore the fragment. 
    [Click here](http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2012/05/using-newinstance-to-instantiate.html) 
    for more information. 

    Since this fragment will contain Entry List Screenlet, its data must include 
    the guestbook ID the Screenlet retrieves entries from (`guestbookId`). Also, 
    the `onCreateView` method uses the bundle arguments set in `newInstance` to 
    retrieve the `guestbookId`. For now, you don't have to do anything with the 
    `guestbookId` in `onCreateView`. You'll use this variable when you add the 
    Screenlet to the fragment. 

Next, you'll add this fragment to `GuestbooksActivity`. 

## Adding the Fragment to GuestbooksActivity [](id=adding-the-fragment-to-guestbooksactivity)

Now that `EntriesFragment` exists, you can add it to `GuestbooksActivity`. To do 
this, you must put an Android fragment container in the layout where you want 
the fragment. For more information, see 
[Android's documentation on adding fragments at runtime](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/fragment-ui.html#AddAtRuntime). 
Since you want Entry List Screenlet to appear in `GuestbooksActivity`, your 
first thought might be to put the fragment container directly in 
`activity_guestbooks.xml`. Don't do this. Recall that Android Studio's 
Navigation Drawer Activity template created the layout `content_guestbooks.xml` 
to hold the activity's main body content. You'll add the fragment container to 
this layout, then write the code in `GuestbooksActivity` that displays the 
fragment. 

Follow these steps to add the fragment to `GuestbooksActivity`: 

1.  Open `content_guestbooks.xml` and place the following fragment container
    inside the `ConstraintLayout`. This fragment container should be the only
    other element inside the `ConstraintLayout`: 

        <FrameLayout
            android:id="@+id/fragment_container"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />

2.  Next, you must write the `GuestbooksActivity` code that displays the
    fragment when a guestbook is selected in Guestbook List Screenlet. You'll do
    this with an 
    [Android fragment transaction](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html#Transactions). 
    Recall that you created `GuestbooksActivity`'s `showEntries` method to
    process a list item selection in Guestbook List Screenlet. All `showEntries`
    does right now is set the action bar's title to the selected guestbook's
    name. You'll add the fragment transaction to `showEntries`, so a guestbook
    selection also shows that guestbook's entries. Replace the `showEntries`
    method in `GuestbooksActivity` with this code: 

        public void showEntries(GuestbookModel guestbook) {
            actionBar.setTitle(guestbook.getName());

            EntriesFragment entriesFragment = EntriesFragment.newInstance(guestbook.getGuestbookId());
            FragmentTransaction transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
            transaction.replace(R.id.fragment_container, entriesFragment);
            transaction.commit();
        }

    This requires that you import `android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction`. 

    This method's `actionBar.setTitle` call is the same as before. Only the 
    fragment code is new. In it, you first use `newInstance` to create a new 
    `EntriesFragment` instance with the selected guestbook's ID. A fragment 
    transaction then adds this fragment to the fragment container. 

Fantastic! Now you have a fragment to put Entry List Screenlet in, and the code 
that displays this fragment in `GuestbooksActivity`. Next, you'll put Entry List 
Screenlet in the fragment.
