# Using the Guestbook List and Entry List Screenlets [](id=using-the-guestbook-list-and-entry-list-screenlets)

Now that you have the Guestbook List and Entry List Screenlets, you're ready to 
put them to work. As you'll see, using these Screenlets isn't much more 
difficult than using Login Screenlet. This is an advantage of Screenlets; it 
typically takes only a few minutes to get them up and running. They also 
integrate with the rest of your app's UI. 

To add your Screenlets to the app, you'll follow these steps: 

1. Understand how `GuestbooksActivity`'s UI works. Since your Screenlets augment 
   this UI instead of replacing it, you should first understand how it works. 

2. Prepare `GuestbooksActivity` for Guestbook List Screenlet. 

3. Use Guestbook List Screenlet by inserting it in `GuestbooksActivity`. 

4. Create `EntriesFragment` for Entry List Screenlet. You'll also set 
   `GuestbooksActivity` to display this fragment when a guestbook is selected in 
   Guestbook List Screenlet. 

5. Use Entry List Screenlet by inserting it in `EntriesFragment`.
