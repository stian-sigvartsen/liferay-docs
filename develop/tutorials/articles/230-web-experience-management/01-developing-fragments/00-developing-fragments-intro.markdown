# Developing Fragments [](id=developing-fragments)

The goal of Fragments is to take a mock-up design and realize it on a web page
as accurately as possible. To do this, developers are given a space where they
have a "blank slate."  You have three tools at your disposal to accomplish this:

*  **HTML**: The markup of the fragment. Fragments use standard HTML with 
   special tags to add dynamic behavior.

*  **CSS**: CSS styles and positions the fragment's markup. 

*  **JavaScript**: JavaScript provides dynamic behavior to the fragment.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all completely standard, just like anywhere
else on the web, but are also enhanced with Liferay-specific features. Some text
areas can be specified as editable, allowing that text to be modified before it
is published. Liferay portlets can also be embedded in Fragments as "widgets"
which enable you to create more dynamic content and pages with Fragments.
