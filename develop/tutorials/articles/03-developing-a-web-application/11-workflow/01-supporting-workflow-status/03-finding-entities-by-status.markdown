    <p>Supporting Workflow at the Service Layer<br>Step 3 of 3</p>
</div>

The service implementation for both entities now supports adding the status
fields to the database tables. There's one more update to make in the service
layer, but to understand why, you must think about the view layer. When the
Guestbook portlet displays entries, you must make sure it doesn't show entries
that haven't been approved. Currently, the entry's view layer shows all
guestbooks:

		List<Guestbook> guestbooks = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil
					.getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId);

There's a problem: the getter only takes the `scopeGroupId` as a parameter, so
there's no way to get guestbooks by their status.

Likewise, unapproved entries must not be displayed, but the view layer currently
gets all entries:

        <liferay-ui:search-container total="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntriesCount()%>">
        <liferay-ui:search-container-results
            results="<%=EntryLocalServiceUtil.getEntries(scopeGroupId.longValue(),
                            guestbookId, searchContainer.getStart(),
                            searchContainer.getEnd())%>" />

The solution is to implement for guestbooks and entries a getter that takes the
`status` field as a parameter. Thankfully, Service Builder makes it easy.

Open the `guestbook-service` module's `service.xml` file. 

For the guestbook entity, add this finder:

    <finder name="G_S" return-type="Collection">
        <finder-column name="groupId"></finder-column>
        <finder-column name="status"></finder-column>
    </finder>

For the entry entity, add this finder:

    <finder name="G_G_S" return-type="Collection">
        <finder-column name="groupId" />
        <finder-column name="guestbookId" />
        <finder-column name="status" />
    </finder>

Run service builder (double-click `guestbook-service/build/buildService` in the
Gradle Tasks pane of IDE). Service Builder generates finder methods in the
persistence layer that take the specified fields (for example, `status`) as
parameters.

Don't call the persistence layer directly in the application code. Instead
expose the new persistence methods in the service layer. 

Open `GuesbookLocalServiceImpl` and add this getter:

	public List<Guestbook> getGuestbooks(long groupId, int status)
		throws SystemException {
		
		return guestbookPersistence.findByG_S(
			groupId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);
	}

This getter gets only approved guestbooks. That's why you hard code the workflow
constant `STATUS_APPROVED` into the status parameter when calling the
persistence method. Now open `EntryLocalServiceImpl` and add these two getters:

	public List<Entry> getEntries(
		long groupId, long guestbookId, int status, int start, int end)
		throws SystemException {

		return entryPersistence.findByG_G_S(
			groupId, guestbookId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);
	}

	public int getEntriesCount(
		long groupId, long guestbookId, int status)
		throws SystemException {

		return entryPersistence.countByG_G_S(
			groupId, guestbookId, WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED);
	}

You'll replace the existing methods with these `getEntries` and
`getEntriesCount` methods in the view layer, ensuring that only approved entries
are displayed. 

The work here relates to the UI updates you'll make later. Next, implement
workflow handlers so that you can call the `updateStatus` service method when
the entity returns from the workflow framework.
