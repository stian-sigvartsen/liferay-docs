# Assets: Integrating with Liferay's Framework [](id=assets-integrating-with-liferays-framework)

@product@'s asset framework transforms entities into a common format that can be 
published anywhere in your site. Web content articles, blog posts, wiki
articles, and documents are some asset-enabled entities that come
out-of-the-box. By asset-enabling your own applications, you can take advantage 
of @product@'s functionality for publishing your application's data across your 
site in the form of asset publisher entries, notifications, social activities, 
and more. 

@product@'s asset framework includes the following features:

- Tags and categories
- Comments and ratings
- Related assets (a.k.a. asset links)
- Faceted search
- Integration with @product@'s Asset Publisher portlet
- Integration with @product@'s Search portlet
- Integration with @product@'s Tags Navigation, Tag Cloud, and Categories 
  Navigation portlets

entities. You'll implement tags, categories, and related assets for guestbooks
