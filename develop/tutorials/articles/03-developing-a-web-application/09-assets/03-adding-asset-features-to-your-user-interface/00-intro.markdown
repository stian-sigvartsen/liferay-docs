# Adding Asset Features to Your User Interface [](id=adding-asset-features-to-your-user-interface)

    <p>Adding Asset Features to Your UI<br>Step 1 of 5</p>

Now that your guestbook and guestbook entry entities are asset-enabled, you're 
ready to use @product@'s asset functionality in your application. You'll start 
by implementing comments, ratings, tags, categories, and related assets for 
guestbooks. Then you'll do the same for guestbook entries. All the back-end 
support for these features is provided by @product@. Your only task is to update 
your applications' user interfaces to use these features. 

In this section, you'll create several new JSPs that need new imports. Add the 
following imports to the `guestbook-web` module project's `init.jsp` file: 

    <%@ page import="java.util.Map" %>
    <%@ page import="java.util.HashMap" %>

    <%@ page import="com.liferay.asset.kernel.service.AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil" %>
    <%@ page import="com.liferay.asset.kernel.service.AssetTagLocalServiceUtil" %>

    <%@ page import="com.liferay.asset.kernel.model.AssetEntry" %>
    <%@ page import="com.liferay.asset.kernel.model.AssetTag" %>

    <%@ page import="com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.ListUtil" %>

It's simpler to add these imports now so you don't run into errors as you're 
working through this section.
