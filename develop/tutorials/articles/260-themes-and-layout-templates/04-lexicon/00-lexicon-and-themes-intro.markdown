# Lexicon CSS and Themes [](id=lexicon-and-themes)

Lexicon CSS is an extension of Bootstrap's CSS Framework. Bootstrap is by far 
the most popular CSS framework on the web. Also, it's open source, so anyone can 
use it. Built with Sass, Lexicon CSS fills the front-end gaps between Bootstrap 
and the specific needs of @product@.

These tutorials look briefly at Lexicon CSS and show you how to use it in your 
@product@ themes.
