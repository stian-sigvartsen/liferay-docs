# Creating a Theme Thumbnail [](id=creating-a-theme-thumbnail)

Theme thumbnails help users quickly identify your theme. It's especially
important to provide thumbnails when your theme offers 
[color schemes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/specifying-color-schemes). 

Here's how to create a proper thumbnail image for your theme:

1.  Create a thumbnail image. Make sure it's 150 pixels wide by 120 pixels high.
    You may want to take a snapshot of your theme and re-size it to these
    dimensions. **Your thumbnail must be these exact dimensions** or the image 
    won't display properly. 

2.  Save the image as a `.png` file named `thumbnail.png` and place it in the
    theme's `images` folder (create this folder if it doesn't already exist). On 
    redeployment, the `thumbnail.png` file automatically becomes the theme's
    thumbnail.

Now, when you apply the theme, its thumbnail displays along with the other
themes that are available to your site.
