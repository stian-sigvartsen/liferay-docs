# Updating the Admin App [](id=updating-the-admin-app)

In the last section of the Learning Path, you updated the design of the End user 
Guestbook app to comply with the Clay design guidelines, providing the user 
with a rich user-experience across all devices. 

In this section you'll apply many of the same changes to the Guestbook Admin app. 
While the end-user sections covered these changes in great detail, the Admin 
sections will focus on the additional updates made to the Guestbook Admin app 
only. The steps that are the same across both apps are summarized for you in 
the next section, and the updated code is provided for you for download. If you 
wish to dive deeper in to the process of applying Clay guidelines to the 
Guestbook App, please refer to the previous sections on the end-user app. 

All the changes for this section are done inside the `guestbookadminmvcportlet` 
folder of the `guestbook-web` module. 

Go ahead and get started.
