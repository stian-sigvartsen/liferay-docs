# UI Overview [](id=ui-overview)

In this portion of the Learning Path, you'll update the current UI and overall 
design of the Guestbook app to match Liferay's Lexicon Design Language standards.
Specifically, you'll be using the web implementation of Lexicon called 
Clay. Clay offers a consistent user experience and design across all of your 
apps. Clay's patterns can be found on their website at 
[http://liferay.github.io/clay/](http://liferay.github.io/clay/). You'll use 
Liferay's Front-end taglibs to update the Guestbook's markup to follow the Clay 
guidelines.

This portion of the Learning Path is divided into two main sections: Updating
the end user app (The app that guests and regular users will interact with), and
updating the Admin Guestbook app (the app that only Administrators will 
manage). The sections covering the end user app will go over the UI updates in 
detail, breaking down each of the changes. The section covering the Admin 
Guestbook app will give a summary of those same changes as they pertain to the 
Guestbook Admin app, while also covering a subtle difference between the two 
portlets.

The figure below shows what the finished UI for the Guestbook and Guestbook
Admin apps will look like at the end of this portion of the Learning Path.
