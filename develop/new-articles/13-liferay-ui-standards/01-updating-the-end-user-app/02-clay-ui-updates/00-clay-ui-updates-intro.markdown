# Clay UI Updates [](id=clay-ui-updates)

So far, you've created the Management Bar for the Guestbook app so users can
organize and sort the guestbook entries. In this section of the Learning Path,
you'll update the Guestbook app's main view and edit view to match the Clay
guidelines.

These updates include UI changes to the edit entry form, menus, navigation, and
search container results.

You'll start by making changes to the main view in the next section.
