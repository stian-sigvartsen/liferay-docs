# Creating the Management Bar [](id=creating-the-management-bar)

In this section of the Learning Path, you'll create the Management Bar for the
Guestbook app and style the Search Container to follow the Clay guidelines.
The Management Bar gives you a great deal of control over how your app's
contents are displayed. You'll configure the Management Bar to organize and sort
the Guestbook entries.

The Management Bar is separated into two key pieces: display buttons, which
specify the type of view to display, and filters, which allow you to sort and
filter the search results for the app. You'll add these separately.

You'll start by creating the Display Style buttons in the next section.
