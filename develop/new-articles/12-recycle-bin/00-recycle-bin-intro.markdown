# Recycle Bin [](id=recycle-bin)

Right now your app has a delete function, but no way to recover entries deleted 
by accident. To fix this you can integrate Liferay's Recycle Bin feature to 
move all deleted assets into the Recycle Bin where they will be preserved
temporarily so that erroneously deleted items can be recovered.
