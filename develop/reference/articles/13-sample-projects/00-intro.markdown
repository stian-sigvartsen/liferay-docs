**Note:** This section of articles does not provide documentation for *all*
sample projects residing in the `liferay-blade-samples` repo. The documentation
for these samples is in progress and will grow over time.

Liferay provides sample projects that target different integration points in
@product@. These projects reside in the
[liferay-blade-samples](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples)
Github repository and can be easily copy/pasted to your local environment. The
sample projects are grouped into three different parent folders based on the
build tools used to generate them:

- `gradle`
- `liferay-workspace`
- `maven`

+$$$

**Note:** The Liferay Workspace folder stores WAR-type samples in a separate
folder named
[wars](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/master/liferay-workspace/wars).
The Gradle and Maven tool folders mix WAR samples with the other sample types
(apps, extensions, etc.).
